    Data: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
    Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), RFM analysis, clustering, and association rule mining.
    Scripts: Python scripts for reusable functions and utilities.
    Results: Output files, visualizations, and any other results generated during the analysis.
    README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

How to Use

    Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone.

    Install Dependencies: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using pip install -r requirements.txt.

    Explore the Notebooks: Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the Notebooks directory. Start with 01_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb to preprocess the data, followed by 02_EDA.ipynb for exploratory data analysis, 03_RFM_Analysis.ipynb for RFM analysis and customer segmentation, and 04_Association_Rule_Mining.ipynb for generating product recommendations.

    Run Scripts: If you want to use any of the Python scripts in the Scripts directory, simply import them into your own code and use the functions provided.
